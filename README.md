# graylog-plesk-eu-dataretention

This project aims to provide a series of tools - together with the excellent Graylog2 logging centralized logging - to comply with the "Directive 2006/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 on the retention of data generated or processed in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks and amending Directive 2002/58/EC"

This directive poses a real threat to the operability of smaller ISPs and professionals providing internet services at a small scale, who normally do not have the infrastructure or the resorces to implement a large-scale data retention as per said directive.

This project shall be seen as an approach to fulfil the requirements of this directive with minimal technical and personnel overhead and using readily available open source software and tools. 

#### Disclaimer: 
In no way does this project make any claim to be compliant, whether fully or in part, with the requirements of said directive, it is upon the user of any of the tools and / or files provided in this repository to check for the compliance with the legal requirements of his own country and how the directive 2006/24/EC has been translated into his own national legislation.
